# X11kernelfont
It looks like a standard linux kernel font, but works in X11 and aims for full unicode support.

basic ascii: DONE
cp437 Graphic chars: DONE
Cyrillic: mostly complete, needs further testing
Extended latin charset: complete (iirc), needs testing.
Hebrew: incomplete(missing characters probably rarely used), needs testing
Greek: incomplete(missing characters probably rarely used), needs testing
Box drawing etc.: good enough for Midnight Commander, but incomplete.
Mathematical symbols: incomplete, need help
Italics: WIP, generated by gbdfed and mostly unedited
Emoji: Contributions welcome!
Misc unicode: eventually
Bold: unlikely in current format (latin script is ugly, cyrillic is unreadable), maybe in a future scalable version.
Truetype: nope.
